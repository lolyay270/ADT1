# ADT1 - 3D Modelling

## Why does this repo exist?
- This repo is for holding my 3Ds Max files. 
- I need a cloud storage to allow me to work from multiple classroom and from home, 
- And I **do not** trust Onedrive as it has already killed an SSD of mine.

## Notes:
- No the commits will not be pretty like a good repo, 
- it will be me commiting all work at the end of class.
- Deal with it.
